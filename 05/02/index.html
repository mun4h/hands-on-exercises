  <h1>Adriaen Block passed by the island during his expeditions in the 1610s, and he described it in a 1625 account of his travels as "an island of reddish appearance," which was "een rodlich Eylande" in 17th-century Dutch, and one popular notion is that this Dutch phrase might have influenced the name Rhode Island.[22][23] (Historians have theorized that this "reddish appearance" resulted from either red autumn foliage or red clay on portions of the shore.)</h1>
